# react-untabbable
An extremely simple and tiny (1.3kB gzipped) utility to make a container and all its children untabbable, but still focusable.
This can be useful in achieving a better accessibility for you components, like a menu with nested panels or the dreaded __carousel__ where you probably want some of the items to be untabbable.

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-untabbable
```

or

```bash
npm i react-untabbable
```

## How does it work?
It quite simply applies the value __-1__ to the tabbable elements inside a container, restoring afterwards when needed.

* First it obtains all the tabbable elements within a container using the package [tabbable](https://github.com/davidtheclark/tabbable)
* The current tabindex of each element is saved
* All focusable elements have their tabindex set to __-1__
* When needed, the previous value for the tabindex is restored to the respective elements

## How to use
You can either use the hook or the component itself, pick what better suits your needs.

### Component

The component supports having more than 1 child and you can mix React elements with simples nodes (string, number, etc..).
Elements **must** support receiving a ref.

| Prop            | Type      | Default | Description                     |
|-----------------|-----------|---------|---------------------------------|
| disabled        | `boolean` | `false` | Restores the tabbable behaviour |

```jsx
import { Untabbable } from 'react-untabbable';

<Untabbable>
    <button>Can't tab into me ðŸ˜¢</button>
    You can mix React elements with simple nodes! (string, number, etc...)
    <div>
        <button>Can't tab into me as well ðŸ˜­</button>
    </div>
</Untabbable>
```

### Hook

| Parameter                | Type             | Default | Description                                       |
|--------------------------|------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------|
| ref                      | `ref` or `ref[]` |         | One or more refs to DOM elements                  |
| options?                 | `object`         | `{}`    |                                                   |
| options.disabled         | `boolean`        | `false` | Restores the tabbable behaviour                   |
| options.includeContainer | `boolean`        | `true`  | If the owner of the ref should also be untabbable |


```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { useUntabbable } from 'react-untabbable';

const MyComponent = () => {
    const firstButtonRef = useRef();
    const secondButtonRef = useRef();

    useUntabbable([firstButtonRef, secondButtonRef]);

    return (
        <div>
            <button ref={firstButtonRef}>
                Can't tab into me ðŸ˜¢
            </button>
            <div ref={secondButtonRef}>
                <button>Can't tab into me as well ðŸ˜­</button>
            </div>
            <button>Still tabbable ðŸŽ‰</button>
        </div>
    );
};
```
